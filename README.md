# Neural-Temporal-Perturbation-Field (This is an ongoing work and is under MIT License)
A Multi Layered Perceptron is fitted to predict output as the input is perturbated continuously. Therefore, A Neural Temporal Perturbation Field is the space of outputs for all possible perturbations across all time.
